										The microc redit loan cycles are usually shorter than traditional commercial loans with terms from typically six months to a year with payments plus interest, payed weekly. Shorter loan cycles and weekly payments help the borrowers stay current and not become surprised by large payments

									<img src="img/p10.jpg" class="pull-left" alt="" width="100%" />
									<p>We follow the credit methodology of Self Help Group lending wherein the loans are disbursed to the members of the group after inter-se-agreement by all the members within the group. The members in a group are selected so as to be in same age group and residing in the same locality being friends but not from the same family. In case of the problems in recovery from even one of the members, the system of joint liability ensures recovery of the dues from all the members within the group.
									</p>
									<p>Apart from the loan disbursement and recovery schedule, the members are invited to attend workshops and training programs, which acts as a platform for all the members to come together and share their experiences. The exposure visits enable members to learn about the various activities undertaken by their counterparts in other villages thereby increasing the number of income generation options and levels of confidence among the members.</p>

										The Atal Pension Scheme will bring security to ageing Indians while at the same time promote a culture of savings and investment among the lower and lower middle class sections of society. One of the greatest benefits of the scheme may be enjoyed by the poorer sections of society.

									<p>Financial inclusion, social security, and low-cost benefits for the masses have been high on the NDA government’s agenda. Ever since the NaMo government’s ascent to the centre, PM Modi, FM Jaitley, and the Cabinet have worked relentlessly towards promulgation of new schemes that make financial security for the common man. The first step towards achievement of social security was the rollout of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY). With Phase I being declared a major success and 1.8 crore accounts having been opened across the country, the government has flagged off three new schemes on 9 May 2015 – two insurance schemes (Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana), and a pension scheme (Atal Pension Yojana). This is called Phase II of the PMJDY, since it was important to get people into mainstream banking before any benefits can be extended to them.
